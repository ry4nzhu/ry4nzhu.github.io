Despite its promising benefits, realizing the full potential of such systems faces significant challenges due to inherent imperfections in underlying system layers, consisting of network layer imperfections and hardware-level noises. Such imperfections and noises include packet loss in vehicular networks, localization errors from GPS measurements, and synchronization errors caused by clock deviation and network latency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end collaborative perception framework, SCORPION, that harnesses the AI co-design of the application layer and system layer to tackle the aforementioned imperfections. SCORPION consists of three main components: lost bird’s eye view feature reconstruction (L-BEV-R) recovers lost spatial features during lossy V2X communication, while deformable spatial cross attention (DSCA) and temporal alignment (TA) compensate for localization and synchronization errors in feature fusion. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world collaborative 3D object detection datasets demonstrate that SCORPION advances the state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods by 5.9 - 13.2 absolute AP on both standard and noisy scenarios.","tags":["Autonomous Vehicle","Cooperative Perception"],"title":"SCORPION: Robust Spatial-Temporal Collaborative Perception Model on Lossy Wireless Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruiyang Zhu*","Minkyoung Cho*","Shuqing Zeng","Fan Bai","Xiang Gao","Z.

However, automatically constructing accurate vectorized maps at scale using learning-based methods remains challenging, as individual vehicles observe only partial, localized environments. This motivates the need for collaborative HD map construction, where multiple vehicles contribute local observations to build a unified global map. While collaborative perception has been extensively studied through dense BEV fusion, existing methods are fundamentally ego-centric and operate within a fixed perception range, making them ill-suited for large-scale, open-world mapping. In this paper, we propose a graph-based sparse fusion framework for collaborative vectorized HD map construction. Vehicles build local HD maps collaboratively and encode them as sparse geometric graphs, which are fused by a sparse-to-sparse fusion algorithm that incrementally aligns and merges graphs across space and time. This design leverages multi-agent fine-grained features and enables scalable, memory-efficient fusion without relying on dense tensors. Experimental results show that our method constructs accurate global maps under sparse and asynchronous observations, outperforming baselines by over 10.3 mAP.","tags":["Autonomous Vehicle","HD-Map"],"title":"Scalable Crowd-Sourced Global HD Map Construction via Collaborative Map Perception and Sparse Graph Fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruiyang Zhu","Xiao Zhu","Anlan Zhang","Xumiao Zhang","Jiachen Sun","Feng Qian","Hang Qiu","Z.

Existing CVP systems employ either a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) view exchange paradigm. In this paper, we advocate a hybrid CVP design: our developed system, Harbor, employs V2I as its fundamental underlying framework, and opportunistically employs V2V to boost the performance. In Harbor, vehicles (helpers) may serve as relays to assist other vehicles (helpees) in reaching an edge node, which performs sensor data merging to produce the extended view. We judiciously partition the workload between the edge and vehicles, develop a robust helper-helpee assignment model, and solve it efficiently at runtime. We conduct both real-world tests and large-scale emulation experiments using two prevailing CAV applications: drivable space detection and object detection. Our real-world evaluation conducted at one of the world’s first purpose-built autonomous driving testbeds demonstrates that Harbor outperforms state-of-the-art V2V- or V2I-only CVP schemes by up to 36% in detection accuracy, resulting in significantly fewer collisions under dangerous driving scenarios.","tags":["Autonomous Vehicle","Cooperative Perception"],"title":"Boosting Collaborative Vehicular Perception on the Edge with Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingzhao Zhang","Shuowei Jin","Ruiyang Zhu","Jiachen Sun","Xumiao Zhang","Alfred Chen","Z.

CAVs' driving decisions rely on remote untrusted data, making them susceptible to attacks carried out by malicious participants in the collaborative perception system. However, security analysis and countermeasures for such threats are absent. To understand the impact of the vulnerability, we break the ground by proposing various real-time data fabrication attacks in which the attacker delivers crafted malicious data to victims in order to perturb their perception results, leading to hard brakes or increased collision risks. Our attacks demonstrate a high success rate of over 86% on high-fidelity simulated scenarios and are realizable in real-world experiments. To mitigate the vulnerability, we present a systematic anomaly detection approach that enables benign vehicles to jointly reveal malicious fabrication. It detects 91.5% of attacks with a false positive rate of 3% in simulated scenarios and significantly mitigates attack impacts in real-world scenarios.","tags":["Autonomous Vehicle","Cooperative Perception","Security"],"title":"On Data Fabrication in Collaborative Vehicular Perception: Attacks and Countermeasures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuowei Jin","Ruiyang Zhu","Ahmad Hassan","Xiao Zhu","Xumiao Zhang","Z.

However, such enhancements require intense computation power that is not affordable for a single mobile device, which hinders their real-world deployment. To address the limitation, we propose OASIS, the first system that facilitates multiple users in close proximity to execute intense neural-enhanced video streaming in real-time. To this end, OASIS intelligently distributes computation tasks among multiple mobile devices, selects appropriate video bitrates and super-resolution models, and optimizes video chunk delivery. As a result, the expensive neural-enhanced streaming is done through distributed collaboration, achieving optimal quality of experience (QoE). We implement and evaluate OASIS on commodity smartphones from different vendors, under various network and computation conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of OASIS: it improves the video streaming QoE by 40%-200% and reduces each participant’s energy consumption by 60% when the system scales up from a single device to six devices.","tags":["Neural-enhanced Video Streaming","Mobile Systems"],"title":"OASIS: Collaborative Neural-Enhanced Mobile Video Streaming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahmad Hassan","Anlan Zhang","Wei Ye","Ruiyang Zhu","Shuowei Jin","Jason Carpenter","Z.

Instead of purely relying on local sensors with limited range, it enables multiple vehicles and roadside infrastructures to share sensor data to perceive the environment collaboratively.

To address these challenges, we develop RAO, an innovative, effective, and lightweight cooperative perception system that merges asynchronous sensor data from different vehicles through our novel designs of motion-compensated occupancy flow prediction and on-demand data sharing, improving both the accuracy and coverage of the perception system. Our extensive evaluation, including real-world and emulation-based experiments, demonstrates that RAO outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by more than 34% in perception coverage and by up to 14% in perception accuracy, especially when asynchronous sensor data is present. RAO consistently performs well across a wide variety of map topologies and driving scenarios.

Measurement studies have shown that frequent handovers cause wild fluctuations in 5G throughput, and worst, service outages. Through a cross-country (6,200km+) driving trip, we conduct in-depth measurements to study the current 5G mobility management practices adopted by three major US carriers. Using this rich dataset, we carry out a systematic analysis to uncover the handover mechanisms employed by 5G carriers, and compare them along several dimensions such as (4G vs. 5G) radio technologies, radio (low-, mid- \u0026 high-)bands, and deployment (SA vs NSA) modes. We further quantify the impact of mobility on application performance, power consumption, and signaling overheads. We identify key challenges facing today’s NSA 5G deployments which result in unnecessary handovers and reduced coverage.
